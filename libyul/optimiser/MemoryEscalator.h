/**
 * Optimisation stage that assigns memory offsets to variables that would become unreachable if
 * assigned a stack slot as usual.
 *
 * Uses CompilabilityChecker to determine which variables in which functions are unreachable.
 *
 * Only variables outside of functions contained in cycles in the call graph are considered. Thereby it is possible
 * to assign globally fixed memory offsets to the variable. If a variable in a function contained in a cycle in the
 * call graph is reported as unreachable, the process is aborted.
 *
 * Offsets are assigned to the variables, s.t. on every path through the call graph each variable gets a unique offset
 * in memory. However, distinct paths through the call graph can use the same memory offsets for their variables.
 *
 * The current argument to the ``memoryinit`` call is used as base memory offset and then replaced by the offset past
 * the last memory offset used for a variable on any path through the call graph.
 *
 * Finally, the StackToMemoryMover is called to actually move the variables to their offsets in memory.
 *
 * Prerequisite: Disambiguator, TODO: anything else?
